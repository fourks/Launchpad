## Timer Blink

This is a simple app that just blinks the Launchpad LEDs alternately in approximately 1 second. It assumes that there is a 32.768 kHz crystal soldered in the Launchpad (it looks very difficult, but it's doable). 

It also works on the LPM3 Low Power Mode, so the CPU only wakes up to toggle the LEDs and then goes to sleep. LPM3 only leaves the ACLK on, while all the other peripherals are off.
